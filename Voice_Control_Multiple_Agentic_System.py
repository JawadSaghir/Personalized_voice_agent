        Avoid slang or overly casual words unless appropriate.

    3.  Set Clear Expectations

        Indicate the format or style you want (e.g., bullet points, essay, code).

        Mention length, tone, or level of detail.

    4.  Include Relevant Details

        Add important context or constraints (deadline, audience, tools).

        Provide examples if applicable.

    5.  Ask Direct Questions

        Frame your request as clear questions or instructions.

        Avoid overly broad or multi-part questions without focus.

    6.  Avoid Assumptions

        Donâ€™t assume prior knowledge unless specified.

        Clarify any technical terms if the audience might not know them.

        Try different versions of your prompt and adjust based on results.

        Refine for clarity and effectiveness over time.

    9.  Use Keywords Strategically

        Highlight important concepts or keywords to guide the response.

    10. Limit Complexity

        Break down complex requests into simpler, manageable parts.
