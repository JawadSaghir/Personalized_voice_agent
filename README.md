# AI-Powered Personalized Voice Assistant | OpenAI Agent SDK

Developed an intelligent voice assistant that automates digital tasks such as sending WhatsApp messages, composing emails, playing YouTube videos, and generating handwritten-style assignments using LLM-generated content.

The system features a Prompt Engineering Layer that acts as a middlemanâ€”converting user voice commands into structured, optimized prompts for precise LLM responses. Built using the OpenAI Agent SDK, the assistant integrates voice recognition, external APIs, and dynamic content generation.

Key Highlights:

Voice-controlled task automation

Prompt engineer module for optimized LLM interaction

Real-time messaging, email, and media playback

Handwriting simulation with AI-generated academic content

Modular architecture with tool-calling and multi-step task execution

This project showcases practical AI integration, voice interface design, and intelligent prompt engineering to enhance everyday productivity.
